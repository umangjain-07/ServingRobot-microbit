# 🤖 Smart Serving Robot | Micro:bit + MakeCode

An interactive, sensor-driven serving robot built using **Microsoft MakeCode** and **Micro:bit**, equipped with gesture, voice, and ultrasonic controls. Ideal for smart hospitality and automation scenarios.

## 📦 Project Overview

This robot combines intuitive controls with real-time responsiveness:

- **Motion Control** via button and tilt gestures
- **Voice Activation** for head movement
- **Tray Control** using tilt detection
- **Contactless Drawer System** powered by ultrasonic sensors

Developed with the [`RoboticsWorkshop`](https://github.com/gigotoys/RoboticsWorkShop) extension.
